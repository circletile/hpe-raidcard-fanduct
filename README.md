3D printable fan duct for HPE P408i-p RAID card

A fan mount and duct I created for the HPE P408i-p RAID card that came with my HPE ML110 Gen10 server. Trying to make to run the server run silent, I designed this to lower overall card temps and exhaust heat rearward. Got the idea from other projects in thingverse, but designed from scratch using a cheap pair of calipers for card dimensions.
